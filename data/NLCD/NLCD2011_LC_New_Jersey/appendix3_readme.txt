Scene List by Path/Row

The shapefile appendix3_nlcd2011_scene_list_by_path_row.shp represents the spatial footprint of a majority of scenes used in change analysiss processing and land cover modeling.  This shapefile contains a comment attribute.  If the comment attribute lists the text "Coastal Area" the path/row is either fully or partially contained in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) mapping partner stewardship area.  NOAA C-CAP stewardship areas might contain some scene selection differences.
