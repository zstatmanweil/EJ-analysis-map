This is the beginning of my Recurse Center project. I am conducting the same type of analysis I did for my thesis but this time entirely in Python. My thesis focused on Pennsylvania, but this project will focus on New Jersey so I can compare my results and see how the analysis may differ.  I am imagining my project will involve the following steps:

- [x] Access and explore the Census demographic data by tract, specifically percent below the poverty line and percent people of color.
- [x] Ue Jupyter Notebooks to explore public water system data, and estimate the population, and their sociodemographic characteristics, within each water system through areal weighting.
- [ ] Same as above but estimate population through dasymetric mapping.
- [ ] Create classes/functions withat will automate the areal weighting and dasymetric processes.
- [ ] Create maps showing the results of my estimations.
- [ ] Conduct a statistical analysis of the results to determining the correlation, if any, between the EJ variables and the SDWA violations.
- [ ] Get those map  and statistical results on the web!
